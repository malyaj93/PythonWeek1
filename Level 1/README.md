# LEVEL - 1

1. Write a program in Python to perform the following operation: If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “Python Training” as a string If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd - Python Training” as a string. 
2. Write a program that accepts a string as input from the user and calculates the number of digits and letters. Input: Hello123 Output: Alphabets: 5 & Number : 3
3. Write a Python program to input marks for five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer. Calculate the percentage and grade according to the following: Percentage >= 90% : Grade A Percentage >= 80% : Grade B Percentage >= 70% : Grade C Percentage >= 60% : Grade D Percentage >= 40% : Grade E Percentage < 40% : Grade F 
4. Write a Python program to find the sum of all odd numbers between two given numbers. Start = 1, stop = 10 Sum of odd numbers: 25
5. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop. 
6. Write a Python program to check if a given number is a perfect number. A Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. Input: 5 Output: No 
7. Write a Python program to check if a string is an anagram of another string. string1 = "listen", string2 = "silent" Output: True 
8. Write a Python program to calculate the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers. number1 = 12, number2 = 18 LCM of 12 and 18 are: 36 
9. Write a Python program to count the frequency of each element in a list. Input_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 5] Frequency count: {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1}
10. Write a Python program to reverse the order of words in a given sentence. Input_sentence = “Hello, World! Welcome to Python programming.” Output after reverse = “programming. Python to Welcome World! Hello,” 
11. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of digits of a given number until the sum becomes a single-digit number. Sample Input: num = 987 Sample Output: Sum_of_digits = 24, Again compute the sum of digits so that it can be reduced to on single digit. Final Output: 6 
12. Write a Python program to reverse a number using a while loop. Sample Input: num = 12345 Sample Output: revnum = 54321
