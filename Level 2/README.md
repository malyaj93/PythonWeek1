# LEVEL - 2

1. Write a Python program to find the common elements between two lists. 
Sample Input: l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and l2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Sample output: [4, 5] 
2. Create a function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. 
Sample Input: list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] Sample Output: list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
3. Given an array of N integers and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K. 
Sample Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 6 Sample Output: Pair count: 2 
4. Given an array of size N. The task is to rotate array by D elements towards right 
Sample Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], D = 2 Sample Output: arr after rotation = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
5. You are developing a program that analyzes weather data. Write a Python function that takes a list of temperature readings for a specific location and determines the average temperature, highest temperature, and lowest temperature. 
Input: temperature_readings = [25, 28, 21, 24, 27] Output: Average Temperature: 25.0 Highest Temperature: 28 Lowest Temperature: 21 
6. Write a Python program to check if a number is a power of two using recursion. 
7. Write a Python function that finds the median of a list of numbers. 
Sample Input: number_list = [7, 2, 5, 1, 9, 3] Sample Output: Median: 4.0 
8. Write a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given string. 
Sample Input: string = "Hello, World!" Sample Output: Number of vowels: 3 
9. Write a Python program that executes an operation on a list and handles an IndexError exception if the index is out of range.
10. We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must have more stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a Python program to find the number of stones in each pile. 
Sample Input: n = 7 Sample Output: Stones in a single pile = [2, 4, 6] 
11. Write a Python program to create a list of given strings individually of the list using the Python map function. 
Eg. Input: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Black', 'White', 'Pink'] Output: [['R', 'e', 'd'], ['B', 'l', 'u', 'e'], ['B', 'l', 'a', 'c', 'k'], ['W', 'h', 'i', 't', 'e'], ['P', 'i', 'n', 'k']] 
12. Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give a chance to enter it again but it should not be more than 3 times. 
13. Write a Python program to find if a given string starts with a given character using Lambda. 
Sample input: input_string = "Hello, World!", given_char = "H" Sample Output: True
